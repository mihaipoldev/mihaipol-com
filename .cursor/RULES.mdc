- Components folder structure: ui are basic (base) components and in other folders are bigger components that might use other components
- We use Feature folder Structure for comps/logic → `features/`  
- Folders:  
  - `app`  
  - `components/`  
  - `features/`  
- Bunny CDN → never `delete`, always `move to trash`  
- ! ICONS: Use **Font Awesome React** icons only.
